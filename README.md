This repo creates a test runner (using AngularJS) that runs automated tests in the browser and reports on their results as soon as each test completes.

NOTE: To run a basic server that will serve the files (display the app),
cd into the directory of this index.html and
type: python -m SimpleHTTPServer


This spec runner was created using AngularJS.
It also used the UI-router for displaying the view.

There is no need to install anything, because both of the above are included 
in the index.html with script tags.

Example:
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.5/angular.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular-ui-router/0.2.18/angular-ui-router.js"></script>

If have time to come back to this, I will improve the styling and add more detailed documenation.
